/**
 * 
 * <p>A card sequence is any collection of cards with a predetermined
 * set of rules that validate its stability. Cards can be added
 * or removed from the sequence whenever possible.
 * 
 * <p>The criteria that determines whether two cards are sequential
 * to one another, or if one card can be added to or removed from the
 * sequence is entirely depended on the construction of the card
 * sequence object. One cannot change its behaviour but by constructing
 * a new card sequence of the appropriate type.
 * 
 * <p>A card sequence can have zero or more listeners that will be
 * notified whenever any of the actions specified in {@link CardSequenceListener}
 * occur. It's important to have listeners in order to handle new sequences
 * being created by splitting and empty sequences by removing.
 * 
 * <p>A card sequence can be iterated through by the {@code for} notation
 * since this class implements the {@link Iterable} interface.
