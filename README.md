# Rummy Card Game

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/guidanoli/rummy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/guidanoli/rummy)

This project is an attempt to make a robust Java application for the game "Rummy", making use of **TravisCI**, **JUnit** and **Maven** - tools that I will get accustomed with through the development. The game will also have a GUI and saving/loading functionalities.
